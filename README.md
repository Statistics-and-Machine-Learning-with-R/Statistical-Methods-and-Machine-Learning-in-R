Click on above link to visit our website.

This repo has been created and organized to work as a mini guide for students with none or very little background in the field of Computer Science, especially in 
Bio-Informatics, to have a general idea and understand the underlying concepts of Statistics paving its way towards Multivariate Statistics & ultimately Machine Learning Algorithms. We have written R scripts for the mentioned pathway as we proceeded which we have provided in our repository along with corresponding csv file which we used 
in our scripting process. 

 * Download our codes, see how the process works for yourself in our elaborately commented scripts. 
 * Visit our [wiki](https://github.com/Statistics-and-Machine-Learning-with-R/Statistical-Methods-and-Machine-Learning-in-R/wiki) which has been designed to enhance your understanding concepts with provision of various sources from where we have learnt as well as actual images of results while we worked on the concepts & scripts

_We tried to acknowledge every possible source which have helped us to create this repository. All of our personal contents are open source & feel free to use them for 
learning, teaching, creating repositories_

**Happy Learning!!**

##  Tools (RScripts) for Data Analysis in Bio-Informatics:

An important aspect of data in bio-informatics being that the data is not often organized in a manner where Rows represent Instances and Columns represent Variables. Rather it is the other way round mostly in population biology, sample study etc. So our codes are tailored to work with datasets which are configured as following :

                       Column(Instance) 1      Column(Instance) 2     . . . .    Column(Instance) n
      
      Row(Variable) 1      (Value)                  (Value)           . . . .         (Value)
      
      Row(Variable) 2      (Value)                  (Value)           . . . .         (Value)
      
      .                       .                        .                                 .
      .                       .                        .                                 .
      .                       .                        .                                 .
      .                       .                        .                                 .
      
      Row(Variable) n      (Value)                  (Value)           . . . .         (Value)
      
Our team has uploaded all the scripts in R language. This may help to understand the usage of Programming in Bio-Informatic. Moreover, under the provided links you will find subfolders each containing a Data-set file, a Programming script in R, and a Read_me file (description about the program). In order to get access to the scripts click on the links mentioned below.

## Theoretical Concepts:

Apart from Codes, our team has also gathered the theoretical approach to all the ANALYSIS which we automated using R. To get the link to that Section click on the link provided under this line: <br/>

## Lectures + Tutorials:

We have also created a series of presentations & R Scripts which can act as a complete tutorial for an individual or a group to learn Statistical Methods & Machine Learning with R

The tutorial consists of presentation files along with a RScript which can be run simultaneously as someone goes through the slides. There is a task as well with each exercise which can provide as an assessment for the learner.
